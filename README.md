# Evolution of pathogenesis-related proteins in plants
This repository contains all the code and data used for the course "Design Project" in the Master of Science in Bioinformatics program at Ghent University. The aim of the project was to characterize the repertoire of PR-encoding genes across 131 plant  species in order to  explore  their  evolutionary  patterns.
